# 6.7.Password.Generator
Password Generator Homework

This assignment entails the process by which I generated a password. 

The password generator program was designed with collected user input. 
With an event listner we created a series of prompts that collected the users input. 
With that data we could determine whether or not to include certain character types in our options array. 
We created a series of FOR and IF loops to choose from the options array based on length min/max and boolean statements.
The result displays the password based on the selected user input.
